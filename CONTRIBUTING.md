# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this list so that other Re:Earth users may use your awesome plugins, please follow the guidelines and understand all information below!

## Guidelines

* Make sure all plugins in your repo are bug free and production ready (this is not the place for plugin feedback or reviewing. Please join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/2bmuJchVKq) and ask the Re:Earth team/community for that.)
* PR titles should be in the format `Add plugin-name`
* One plugin repo per PR

## Expectations

We hope to keep this list as awesome as possible and as helpful to Re:Earth users as possible.
Because of this, we will only add plugins that we feel are up to a certain standard (bug free, maintainable, etc). 
We will be more lenient on the TYPE of widget, as we hope Re:Earth will be used in all industries and by all kinds of people. 
That being said, since we are a small team, if we get many PRs at once we might prioritize reviewing and accepting widgets that seem suitable to a larger user-base (in particular, GIS-related plugins).

## Acceptance or Rejection

We will review the repo's source code and then test it before approving it on to the list.
We will do our best to leave a reason why if we decide to reject a PR, but there might be times that we can't/don't (in particular, if a PR doesn't follow the guidelines or is deemed spam).

## Community help

As the core Re:Earth team, we will do our best to keep this list awesome. 
But if a dud plugin falls through the cracks, degrades or just doesn't seem too awesome, feel free to start a discussion on Discord!
Keep it civil. Keep it about the code. Keep it productive.
